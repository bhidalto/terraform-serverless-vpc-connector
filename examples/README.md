# How to create a Serverless VPC access connector

This example demonstrates how to create a [Serverless VPC access connector](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/configure-serverless-vpc-access).

## Usage

1. ```
   terraform init -upgrade
   ```

2. ```
   terraform apply
   ```
If you want to edit or change the variable's name, such as the Serverless VPC access connector name, just edit the `variables.tf` file and modify the variable's value.

Afterwards, if you have already initialized terraform, just run terraform apply and you will be ready to go!
